## Example Usage

### Simple stack
{{tffile "examples/resources/cm_stack/resource.tf"}}

### Stack that requires two different users to approve a deployment. Also, when a new drift is detected, a deployment will be starting automatically and will also wait for 2 approvals.
{{tffile "examples/resources/cm_stack/resource2.tf"}}

### Stack that is configured to use a specific terraform version. Also configured with a TTL to run only 3 hours.
{{tffile "examples/resources/cm_stack/resource3.tf"}}

### Stack for which any plan/deployment would also trigger its all sub-directories. This stack's plan/deployment runs are configured to run in a self-hosted runner under the runner-group "dev-runner"
